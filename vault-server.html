<h2>Vault Server (Docker)</h2>
This is a server that stores files in encrypted vaults. Encryption is implemented using 256 bit AES using standard python library. <br>
The data can also be decrypted using a windows app like VaultWindows (here)<br>
This server exposes the vault over http(s) (for browser use) or WebDAV (over https, to be mounted in windows, mac or android)
<h3>Usage</h3>
The server needs access to a folder where all vaults are stored (/Vault in example)
<code>
docker run -it -p 8080:80 -v {VaultFolder}:/Vault ghcr.io/thecuriousgeek/vault-server -f /Vault
</code>
To run under https accessible in host server.local
<code>
docker run -it -p 8443:443 -v {VaultFolder}:/Vault ghcr.io/thecuriousgeek/vault-server -f /Vault -h server.local
</code>
